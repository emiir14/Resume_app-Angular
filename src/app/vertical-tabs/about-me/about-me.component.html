      Iâ€™m a software enthusiast in front end languages constantly wanting to learn
      more, i have always been a fan of programming but just recently decided to
      dive into it professionally. My english skills are advanced, both in talking
      and writing. I have no corporative experience in development, just as a
      freelancer, such as making web-pages for my family business. I look forward
      to be part of a challenging team and develop my programming skills.
